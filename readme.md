# Tonal - A Social Music Marketplace
Thank you for jumping onboard this project! The goal with this is to create an incredible new way for musicians to sell their music, and create a new digital experience for fans to enjoy their favorite music. I'm interested in getting any and all Las Vegas area coders (or elsewhere!) to jump onboard the project on a part-time or full-time basis, as your availability allows. I look forward to working with you!

## Getting Started:

Step 1: Clone this repo
Step 2: Head to this repo's Wiki tab and create those environment files within your project.
Step 3: Navigate to the project root directory and run `npm install` to get dependencies.
Step 4: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server & webpack build.

The project should be viewable on `localhost:3000`.

If you have any issues getting started, please let me know on the [Tonal Slack channel](https://tonalmusic.slack.com/ "Tonal Slack channel").
